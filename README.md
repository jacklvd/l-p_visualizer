# A Path and LinkedList Visualizer

## Description:
I created this Maze traversal and Linked List visualization to kind of reviewing the data structure and see how it got applied.

## Backend:
I develop the backend in `Fastapi`

run the project by following

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/active
pip install -r requirements.txt
fastapi dev app/main.py
```

the project will appear something like this
